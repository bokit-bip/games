Bloxorz is a 3d puzzle game in 33 stages published on Miniclip in 2007. The original version was developed by by [Damien Clarke](https://damienclarke.me/).  

The objective of the game is to get the block to fall into a square hole that is at the end of each stage, there are 33 stages to complete.

[Quick Bloxorz](https://www.quickblox.cc) is a low poly HTML5 version with no animations. It is intended to keep accessible the original puzzle designs, as well as to offer a way for non-programmers to design puzzles with the same mechanics. 

The Bloxorz speedrunning community has also found it useful to optimize and practice runs.  Quick Blozorz includes a speedrun clock that  can be enabled in the options menu.
